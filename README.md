# JS_Mousetime2
 My 2nd big project in Javascipt, using p5 library

This games requires dexternity, to survive endless projectiles and lasers.
The goal of the game is to not get hit as long as possible.
You control the player using only mouse (later you can use space for temporary barrier)

To open the game locally you need to enable local picture stream in your browser.
You can play the game on this site: https://dante.mangowcy.pl/JS/mousetime2/Mouse.html
The site is using cookies to keep track of your progress.
 
There is some inside currency to buy upgrades between the runs.
Good luck!
